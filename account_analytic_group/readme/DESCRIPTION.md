This module is designed to restore the Analytic Group functionality that
was present in versions prior to the 16.0 update.

## Background

In Odoo 16, the 'Analytic Group' feature was replaced with the 'Analytic
Plan'. This new feature allows better tracking of costs and revenues by
project or department. However, we were using 'Analytic Group' for
timesheet grouping, which is incompatible with the new feature. This
module is designed to bring back the 'Analytic Group' functionality to
meet our specific needs.
